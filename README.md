# HTGA
This is HighTide's official app!

## About
**HTGA DOS** is a port of HighTide's official app for **DOS** and **MS-DOS** systems. HTGA stands for *HighTide General App*. This app can be used to keep track of what HighTide is doing. It will be updated very regularly! The HTGA is an easy to use way for HighTide's followers to catch up with his projects. Whenever HighTide starts a new project, the app will be updated to have that project in a list of current projects. If you want to stay up to date without using this app, you can follow me here on GitHub so you never miss a new project. With this app you can do more than just look at the things I do... You can also generate random things, make art, create files easily, and much much more. I really hope you enjoy this awesome level!

## The Team
Sadly, I am working on this project alone as I need to make this perfect to match my needs and your needs. The HighTideTeam is not all working on this project at the same time to make it easier to make!

## Issue Tracking
At the moment, I am working on getting the **issue tracker** that is built-in to GitHub working with this repository. I think with this feature, me and anyone else whom may help me in future development will have a great view on all the issues that arrise in this repository or entire program for that matter. At the moment, I am relying on the **projects tab** in this repository making this a huge step in the right direction for me and everyone else. If you are wondering, **the projects tab** is hidden to the public making it invisible to anyone who isn't a part of the projects development team.
