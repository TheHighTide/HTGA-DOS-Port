Why did the scarecrow succeed in its job?
It was outstanding in its field!
I told my wife she draws eyebrows to high.
She looked suprised.
Why don't scientists trust atoms?
Because they make up everything!
I only know 25 letters of the alphabet.
I don't know y.
Why don't skeletons fight eachother?
They don't have the guts!
I used to play piano by ear.
But now I use my hands and fingers.
Why did the bycicle fall over?
Because it was two-tired!
I told my computer I needed a break.
And now it won't stop sending me vacation ads.
Why don't scientists trust stairs?
Because they're always up to something!
